# Implementation Summary: File Transfer and End-to-End Encryption

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of file transfer and end-to-end encryption features in the CLI Chat application version 1.1.0.

## File Transfer Implementation

### Features
- Secure file transfers between users
- Base64 encoding for file data transmission
- SHA-256 hash verification for file integrity
- Automatic downloads directory creation
- 10MB file size limit for performance
- Database tracking of file transfers
- User confirmation before saving received files

### Implementation Details
1. **Server-side handling**:
   - Added `/file` command processing in `server.py`
   - Implemented file data parsing and validation
   - Added database recording of file transfers
   - Added file integrity verification with SHA-256 hashing

2. **Client-side handling**:
   - Added file sending functionality in `client.py`
   - Implemented file reception and saving
   - Added user confirmation before saving files
   - Added automatic downloads directory creation

3. **Database changes**:
   - Added `FileTransfer` model to track file transfers
   - Fields include: filename, size, sender, receiver, status, and hash

## End-to-End Encryption Implementation

### Features
- End-to-end encryption for private messages
- RSA key generation and exchange protocol
- AES message encryption/decryption
- Secure storage for encryption keys
- Visual indicators for encrypted messages
- Key management commands

### Implementation Details
1. **Encryption Manager**:
   - Created `encryption.py` utility module
   - Implemented RSA key pair generation and storage
   - Implemented hybrid RSA/AES encryption scheme
   - Added key exchange and management functionality

2. **Client-side Integration**:
   - Added encryption commands in `client.py`:
     - `/keygen` - Generate new encryption keys
     - `/sendkey` - Send public key to another user
     - `/encrypt` - Enable encryption with a user
   - Modified whisper handling to support encryption
   - Added visual indicators for encrypted messages

3. **Key Exchange Protocol**:
   - Public keys are exchanged via whisper messages
   - Keys are stored in user's home directory
   - Keys persist between sessions

## Code Structure Changes

1. **New Files**:
   - `src/utils/encryption.py` - Encryption utilities

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `src/backend/server.py` - Added file transfer handling
   - `src/frontend/client.py` - Added file transfer and encryption UI
   - `src/database/models.py` - Added FileTransfer model
   - `src/utils/__init__.py` - Added encryption module imports
   - `cli_chat.py` - Updated version number
   - `README.md` - Updated documentation
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Added detailed changelog

## Testing

Both features were tested with multiple users to ensure:
1. Files can be sent and received correctly
2. File integrity is verified
3. Encryption keys can be exchanged
4. Messages can be encrypted and decrypted

## Future Improvements

1. **File Transfer**:
   - Add progress indicators for large files
   - Implement file compression
   - Add file type validation

2. **Encryption**:
   - Add support for group message encryption
   - Implement perfect forward secrecy
   - Add key rotation functionality
